# findMedian.py
This script contains a function called findMedian which takes an input parameter of file which contains a set of numbers in each line. The function reads the file, generates 
a list of numbers from the files, sorts the list in ascending order and then return the median from the list. Here I have used statiscs module of python library to determine the 
median of the list
