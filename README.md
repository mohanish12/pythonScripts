# pythonScripts
this repository contains python scripts written by me for various use cases

## findMedian.py
This script contains a function called findMedian which takes an input parameter of file which contains a set of numbers in each line. The function reads the file, generates 
a list of numbers from the files, sorts the list in ascending order and then return the median from the list. Here I have used statiscs module of python library to determine the 
median of the list

## next_fib.py
This scrit contains a function next_fib which takes two parameters as input- list of numbers, and the count of numbers to append to this list. It appends the count number of fibonacci integer in the sequence to the list and returns the new list

## Abstract_Names.py
This script  has a function abstract_names which takes input parameter as a list of lists. Each list is a list of names each with a first name and a last name. The function returns a dictionary. The keys to the dictionary are the first names and the values are the list of the associated last names. The last names are sprted alphabetically.
